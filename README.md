# Modern Business Wordpress Theme

A Wordpress theme built on [Roots](http://roots.io) with design by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/modern-business)

## Installation

Just like Roots, clone the git repo - `git clone https://github.com/jaechick/wp-modern-business.git` - or [download it](https://github.com/jaechick/wp-modern-business/archive/master.zip) and then rename the directory to the name of your theme or website. [Install Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started), and then install the dependencies for Roots contained in `package.json` by running the following from the Roots theme directory:

```
npm install
```

Reference the [theme activation](http://roots.io/roots-101/#theme-activation) documentation to understand everything that happens once you activate Roots.

## Theme Development

After you've installed Grunt and ran `npm install` from the theme root, use `grunt watch` to watch for updates to your LESS and JS files and Grunt will automatically re-build as you write your code.
